# hello-world
My first repository!
My name is Ernesto and this is my first repository using GitHub.
I'm about to finish my undergraduate degree for Psychology.
I like write on my blog, make music, and learn about audio production.
I want to learn about data science, and possibly work as a data scientist in the future.
I'm currently learning R and RStudio. My goal is to be able to learn Python as well. 
This repository was created using the Hello Wolrd guide from GitHub.
